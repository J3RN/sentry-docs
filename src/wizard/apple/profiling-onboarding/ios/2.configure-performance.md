#### Configure Performance

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

    // Example uniform sample rate: capture 100% of transactions
    // In Production you will probably want a smaller number such as 0.5 for 50%
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```
